		<h2 class="center">Journey to the End of the Night</h2><br />
		
		<p><strong>The city spreads out before you. Rushing from point to point, lit by the slow strobe of fluorescent buses and dark streets. Stumbling into situations for a stranger's 
		signature. Fleeing unknown pursuers, breathing hard, admiring the landscape and the multitude of worlds hidden in it.</strong></p>
	
		<p>Journey to the End of the Night is a free street game of epic proportions run by volunteer masterminds in cities around the world.</p>
		
		<p>It is a race/chase through city streets at night.</p>
		
		<p>You will try to make it to six checkpoints as fast as you can, while avoiding being caught by chasers. Those who are caught will become chasers 
		themselves, rising to pursue their former friends and allies.</p>
		
		<h3>When & Where</h3>
		<ul class="event-list list-none">
			<li>When: TBC</li>
			<li>Meet Location: TBC</li>
		</ul><br />
		
		<h3>Signup</h3>
		<p>Coming soon.</p>
		
		<h3>The Race Itself</h3>
		<p>When you sign in, you will be given a map (indicating the checkpoints) and two ribbons. The player ribbon you tie on your arm at the beginning 
		- it identifies that you are a player, and it must be clearly visible.</p>
		
		<p>At the start of the event, you will be instructed who to look for at the first checkpoint. Once given the signal to begin, you should immediately 
		start moving to the first checkpoint. Once you reach it, you must find the agent waiting to sign your map. The agent will then tell you who to look for 
		at the next checkpoint; and so on until you reach the end, where there will be drinks and merriment.</p>
		
		<p>Whoever reaches the end first (still alive) wins.</p>
		
		<p>Throughout the race, chasers will try to stop you, handily identifiable by their chaser ribbon. If tagged, your job is to find and tag the other 
		players, preventing them from safely reaching the finish.</p>
		
		<p>There are some areas where you will be safe from chasers. An area around each checkpoint will be safe, an area for you to rest and recover; these 
		areas will be marked on your map. In addition, all transit stations, trains and buses are safe. While in these safe zones, you cannot tag or be tagged.</p>
		
		<p>You must go to the checkpoints in order. Prizes will be awarded for top finishers, best chaser, and other categories determined by the organisers.</p>
		
		<h3>What to bring on the night:</h3>
		<ul class="event-list list-none">
			<li>Bus money/card</li>
			<li>Water and maybe a snack</li>
			<li>Sneakers/comfy shoes you can run in</li>
			<li>A flashlight</li>
		</ul><br />
		
		<h3>The Rules</h3>
		<ul class="event-list list-none">
			<li>This is a footraceâ€“only your own two feet and public transit are permitted. No bicycles, no skates, no cars, no taxis.</li>
			<li>Player/chaser ribbons must be visible at all times.  Hiding either of your ribbons is considered cheating.</li>
			<li>Whoever reaches the end first (still alive) wins.</li>
			<li>If a chaser tags you, you must give them your player ribbon as a trophy; you now put on your chaser ribbon and become a chaser yourself.</li>
			<li>All transit stations, trains and buses are safe. While in these safe zones, you cannot tag or be tagged.</li>
			<li>Additional safe zones exist around checkpoints.</li>
			<li>Checkpoints must be attended in order.</li>
			<li>You must sign up to play (we will not have extra maps/ribbons just because you didn't bother filling in a tiny online free form)</li>
			<li>Chasers start 10 minutes after players.</li>
			<li>You must go to check points in order.</li>
			<li>Transport must be by foot or bus - no bikes, skate boards, cars, trucks, planes, trains, unicorns, etc</li>
			<li>No tagging in safe zones or on buses</li>
			<li>No taking extra ribbons (be fair as it's just a game for fun and cheating means you didn't really win anyways)</li>
			<li>All laws apply so no cutting through random house/properties, no hitting/assaulting other players</li>
			<li>Under 17 and you must have parental permission. 15 and under should be with a parent or responsible party.</li>
		</ul><br />
		
		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Journey to the End of the Night will require a good bit of walking and running. You should definitely make sure that whatever you're wearing on your feet, 
		you're going to be able to outpace an enthusiastic chaser in them. Cosplay/dressing up is encouraged, but again - you might want to check you can run in your 
		costume.</p>
