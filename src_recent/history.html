		<p><strong>SANCon is organised by nine different University of Canterbury clubs - the University of Canterbury Science Fiction and Fantasy Society (Sci-Fi Soc), SAGA Inc., KAOS, the UC Fencing Society, 
		Ordo Cygni, ImprovSoc, AnimeSoc, CompSoc, and Reason & Science Soc.</strong>
		<br /><br />
		The University of Canterbury Science Fiction and Fantasy Society is dedicated to the appreciation of various futuristic and historical (or pseudo-historical) literature and filmography, which is a 
		fancy way of saying that they've seen all the episodes of Farscape. Since their inception they have been heavily involved in the promotion of science fiction and fantasy, organising regular TV 
		viewings as well as booking entire cinemas for movie premieres. Sci-Fi Soc are the founding organisation of SANCon.
		<br /><br />
<!-- 		SAGA Inc. is one of the University of Canterbury's oldest continuously-running non-faculty clubs, and is concerned with all forms of social gaming. They maintain a wide array of board games, and 
		host regular events featuring board gaming and role playing. Their annual convention, Buckets of Dice, draws gamers from world-wide. -->

<!-- 		The UC Fencing Society follows the time honoured tradition of sticking your enemies with metal rods just long enough that you probably won't get blood on your morning suit while keeping the whole 
		thing refreshingly personal. Nowadays, health and safety requires that they blunt the rods and wear armour, but it's still the best excuse to get dressed up in a Kevlar body-suit. -->

		Ordo Cygni, the University of Canterbury Medieval and Renaissance Society, practises the forgotten arts - bashing each other with swords, drinking mead, and dying of smallpox. Given the way MAF 
		cracks down on smallpox, however, it's mostly the first two. They hold a number of weekly events, including bashing people with swords, bashing people with other types of swords, and bashing 
		people with poleaxes.
		<br /><br />
<!-- 		ImprovSoc meets to develop the art of being spontaneous. They meet to have a few laughs, polish their rapier wit and let loose their inner drama queen. Emulating popular TV sketch shows such as 
		Whose Line is it Anyway? or Would I Lie to You? they like to get together and make a scene. -->

		CompSoc is the University of Canterbury's Computer Society, providing opportunities for students and computer enthusiasts to make new friends, get involved with the department, meet industry 
		leaders and have fun! Essentially, we're a social & academic club for people with an interest in computers and the people and science behind them. Find us on Facebook.
		<br /><br />
 		Reason & Science Society is a group of students with an interest in reason, science, philosophy and everything else related to understanding the world from a rational standpoint. We are concerned 
		with critical assessment of the reasoning and evidence behind claims and beliefs, in order to discover what is true, important or applicable to society and to ourselves.
		
		AnimeSoc is a free club dedicated to the style of cartoon known as anime and the associated otaku subculture. We have regular meetings, an amazing member base and countless good times talking about 
		the shows we love.
