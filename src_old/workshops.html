			<h3 id="all-geek">Academic presentation: "It's all geek to me"</h3>
			<p>When: Saturday<br />
			Description: Superhero comic book fandom is part of an intersecting matrix of related fandoms and interests which 
			can be considered a resistant subculture (“geekdom”). Geekdom can be considered a resistant subculture 
			because it involves the alternative uses of media texts, group practices, and because such obsessive interests 
			are not seen as ‘normal’. The nature of comic book ‘geekdom,’ is explored by looking at the ways in which 
			comic book readers actively constitute themselves as members of a subculture through their (gendered) 
			interactions with other comic book readers.<br />
			Through examining fan interactions I examine the ways that participants ‘do geekdom’ to create a feeling of 
			connection within the context of focus groups to constitute a group geek identity. Geek communities have a 
			considerable gender imbalance, so I discuss how doing geekdom was a gendered practice. At different times they 
			utilised a wide range of (sub)cultural resources to create a feeling of connectedness within the group, while 
			at others those same resources were used to compete, exclude or marginalise individuals within the research groups. </p>

			Description: A viewing of an American documentary from Cosplayer Nation covering cosplay from the 
			perspective of cosplay history, cosplayers, fans, parents, celebrities, the public and news media.

			<h3 id="reason-science">Our Sci-Fi Future</h3>
			<p>When: Saturday &amp; Sunday<br />
			Description: Our Sci-Fi Future: Science fiction and fantasy as a tool to explore the future of science and technology.

			At SANcon 2013 FRG would like to hold Test Games so as to validate core game mechanics, discovering in the process if they work as planned. Your support 
			and opinions could be the deciding factor in creating a fully working game for release earlier rather than later.<br />
			FRG holds all rights of intellectual property regarding Zombie Invasions and Test Gamers will be asked to sign a disclosure preventing them from copying 
			or otherwise reproducing, without consent, any of Zombie Invasions rules, structure or art work.</p>
