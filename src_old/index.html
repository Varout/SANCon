            <h2>Venue</h2>
            
            <p>SANCon will be held at Kirkwood Village (<a href='res/maps/map-inset.jpg' target='_blank'>map</a>) at the University of Canterbury, Ilam, 
			Christchurch. We've expanded our dominion this year, hiring even more rooms to host even more people in even more events.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            
            <p>SANCon was started in 2011 by six University of Canterbury clubs. Our goal: to make a popular culture convention, each of us helping out in any 
			way we could. It was held at the Christchurch College of Education on September 17-18 2011. We ran minimal advertising and tried to source as much 
			talent as we could from within our own clubs. We thought it would be a fun little event for University students to turn up to.</p>
            
            <p>We ended up having 140 people walk through the door over the weekend. The premium workshops were almost all booked out by the time doors opened. 
			It was standing room only in the board gaming room. The event was a huge success.</p>
            
            <p>This year we have funds, we have a history, and we have experience. Our goal is to make SANCon 2013 not just as good as SANCon 2011 and 2012, 
			but far, far better.</p>

            <h2>About Us</h2>
            
			<!--	Have layout like the stalls page.  Small icon for the club.  Have a :hover transition: .3 - .5;, width: 100%;

            <p><strong>SANCon</strong> is organised by nine different University of Canterbury clubs - the University of Canterbury Science 
			Fiction and Fantasy Society (Sci-Fi Soc), SAGA Inc., KAOS, the UC Fencing Society, Ordo Cygni, ImprovSoc, AnimeSoc, CompSoc, and
			Reason &amp; Science Soc.</p>

			<!--	Scifi Soc	-->
			<p><a href="http://scifi.org.nz/" target="_blank">The University of Canterbury Science Fiction and Fantasy Society</a> is dedicated 
			to the appreciation of various futuristic and historical (or pseudo-historical) literature and filmography, which is a fancy way of 
			saying that they've seen all the episodes of <em>Farscape</em>. Since their inception they have been heavily involved in the promotion 
			of science fiction and fantasy, organising regular TV viewings as well as booking entire cinemas for movie premieres. Sci-Fi Soc are 
			the founding organisation of SANCon.</p>

			<!--	SAGA	-->
            <p><a href="http://www.saga.org.nz/"target="_blank">SAGA Inc.</a> is one of the University of Canterbury's oldest continuously-running non-faculty clubs, and is 
			concerned with all forms of social gaming. They maintain a wide array of board games, and host regular events featuring board gaming and role playing. 
			Their annual convention, Buckets of Dice, draws gamers from world-wide.</p>
            
			<!--	KAOS	--
            <p><a href="http://kaos.org.nz/"target="_blank">KAOS</a> is the founding branch of a national organisation for the pursuit of Killing As an Organised Sport. Probably 
			the only club on campus with a constitutionally-elected dictator, their members practise the art of wearing lots of leather and shooting each other 
			with nerf guns.</p>
            
			<!--	UC Fencing	-->
            <p><a href="http://ucfencing.net/"target="_blank">The UC Fencing Society</a> follows the time honoured tradition of sticking your enemies with metal rods just long 
			enough that you probably won't get blood on your morning suit while keeping the whole thing refreshingly personal. Nowadays, health and safety requires 
			that they blunt the rods and wear armour, but it's still the best excuse to get dressed up in a Kevlar body-suit.</p>
            
			<!--	Ordo Cygni	-->
            <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/110448079041811/"target="_blank">Ordo Cygni</a>, the University of Canterbury Medieval and Renaissance Society, practises the 
			forgotten arts - bashing each other with swords, drinking mead, and dying of smallpox. Given the way MAF cracks down on smallpox, however, it's mostly the 
			first two. They hold a number of weekly events, including bashing people with swords, bashing people with other types of swords, and bashing people with 
			poleaxes.</p>
            
			<!--	ImprovSoc	-->
            <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/156856824432114/" target="_blank">ImprovSoc</a> meets to develop the art of being spontaneous. They meet to have a few laughs, 
			polish their rapier wit and let loose their inner drama queen. Emulating popular TV sketch shows such as <em>Whose Line is it Anyway?</em> or <em>Would I 
			Lie to You?</em> they like to get together and make a scene.</p>
			
			<!--	CompSoc	-->
			<p><a href="http://www.compsoc.org.nz/" target="_blank">CompSoc</a> is the University of Canterbury's Computer Society, providing opportunities for students and computer enthusiasts to make 
			new friends, get involved with the department, meet industry leaders and have fun! Essentially, we're a social &amp; academic club for people with an interest in 
			computers and the people and science behind them.  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UcCompSoc" target="_blank">Find us on Facebook</a>.</p>
			
			<!--	UC Gaming Guild	--
			<p><a href="http://www.ucgg.org.nz/" target="_blank">The UC Gaming Guild</a> is a group for Cantabrians who love to game! You don't have to be a student at the University of Canterbury to join, 
			just live in Christchurch and be into games! The UCGG hosts at least 1 LAN and 1 console event each term which are based at the University of Canterbury.  
			<a href="https://www.facebook.com/UCGamingGuild/" target="_blank">Find us on Facebook</a>.</p>	-->
			
			<!--	Reason & Science Society	-->
			<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/rsschch/" target="_blank">Reason &amp; Science Society</a> is a group of students with an interest in reason, science, philosophy and everything else 
			related to understanding the world from a rational standpoint. We are concerned with critical assessment of the reasoning and evidence behind claims and beliefs, in order to 
			discover what is true, important or applicable to society and to ourselves.</p>
